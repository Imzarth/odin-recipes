    <h1>One Bowl Banana Bread</h1>

    <img src="./imgs/bananabread.jpeg">

    <h2>Quick and easy Banana Bread</h2>
   
        <p>The beauty of this banana bread recipe is you don't need a fancy mixer! A mixing bowl, a fork to whisk the eggs, and a sturdy spoon to mix the batter are all you need.</p>
   
        <p>This recipe calls for an 8- x 4-inch loaf pan, which produces a tall loaf. The recipe will also work in an 8 1/2- x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan, producing a slightly shorter bread. Since the pan is a bit larger, the bake time is shorter: 47 to 57 minutes. A 9- x 5-inch pan will yield an especially short but still delicious bread; bake for 45 to 55 minutes.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients

    </h3>
